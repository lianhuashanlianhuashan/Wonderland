Implements numeric validation, sequence analysis, and multi-directional pattern search over lists and matrices.


Demonstrated skills:

Designed and implemented algorithms for digit-based validation, sequence transformation, and statistical computation

Manipulated 1D and 2D data structures, including matrix transposition and diagonal traversal

Implemented pattern-search logic across rows, columns, and diagonals with support for reversed sequences

Applied defensive programming through explicit preconditions and boundary checks
